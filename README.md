# Fake News Detection using GNN Models
This project aims to detect fake news on Twitter using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. The models are built using PyTorch and PyG.
## Getting Started
You can run the code either on Colab or by cloning the repository.
### Running on Colab
To run the code on Colab, click [`here`](https://github.com/Danial-sb/FakeNewsDetection/blob/main/FinalProject.ipynb) to open the notebook.
### Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Danial-sb/FakeNewsDetection`
Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the program:<br/>
`python run.py`
You can change the arguments in your preferences, for example for changing the dataset, you can use the following command:<br/>
`python run.py --dataset="politifact"`
